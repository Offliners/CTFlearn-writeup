# I DID NOT CREATE THE ORIGINAL GAME, BUT John_123 created it.
# Link: https://repl.it/@John_123/Lazy-Game

# Modified by theKidOfArcrania
# Changelog from John_123's version:
# - I decreased sleep times (they were a little bit of a 
#   nuisance to wait).
# - Made the input be case insensitive (if you type in 'y'
#   it will not register this as yes response).
# - Fix OBOE error when user gets 11th guess (but it doesn't 
#   count).
# - Added a millionare challenge!
